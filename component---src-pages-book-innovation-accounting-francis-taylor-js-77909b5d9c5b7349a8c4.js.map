While it does not ignore regulatory and \n    administrative requirements provided by traditional accounting systems, \n\tinnovation accounting encourages the identification and \n    measuring of metrics that provide relevant feedback to the library \n\tsystems delivering services or resources.\n\t</p>\n\t<p>\n\tThe types and methods of gathering statistics from library services and resources is\n    reminiscent of ideas and philosophies behind one of the twentieth century's \n    most influential management thinkers and educators, Francis Taylor. Taylor \n\tattempted to scientifically optimize the workflows of a \n\ttypical laborer in a factory. Taylor's ideas have had a large impact on library \n\tsystems' organization and processes, which, with some \n    modification, can be implemented by a lean library using a variant of innovation \n\taccounting that is especially adapted to the needs and \n    circumstances of libraries\n    </p>\n    </article>\n   </div>\n </div>\n</div>\n</Layout>)\n\nexport default InnovationAccountFrancisTaylorPage\n"],"sourceRoot":""}
