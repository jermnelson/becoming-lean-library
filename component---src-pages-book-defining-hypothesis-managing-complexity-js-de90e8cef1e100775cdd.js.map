Library services platforms, discovery layers, and \n\tcloud offerings; mobile operating systems such as Android, iOS, and \n    Windows; and supported tablets and workstations of library patrons \n\tand staff are expected services in a library. The lean library approach \n\tusing the build-measure-learn cycle requires the creation of actionable \n\tand specific hypotheses to better measure and respond to the \n    actual requirements of the library's users. This chapter goes through a \n\tstep-by-step process of creating usable hypotheses in the library's \n    decision making\n\t</p>\n    </article>\n    <section class=\"col-md-6\">\n      <h3>Annotations &amp; Notes</h3>\n\t  <h3>Badge Assessment</h3> \n\t  <h3>Blog Post(s)</h3>\n    </section>\n  </div>\n </div>\n \t\t\t\t <h3>Key Concepts</h3>\n\t\t\t\t Business model canvas; Continuous improvement; Hypothesis; Muda; Mura; Muri\n</div>\n    </Layout>)\n\nexport default DefiningHypothesisManagingComplexity\n"],"sourceRoot":""}
