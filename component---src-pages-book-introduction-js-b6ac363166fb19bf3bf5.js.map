These principles enable libraries to better respond and adapt to changing technology demands from patrons while \n      maximizing personnel and resources under static or declining budgets. \n     </p>\n     <p>\n     Becoming a Lean Library offers specific strategies for applying \n      lean principles to organizations of all sizes and types, including memory institutions such as libraries, museums, and archives. Building \n      on a strong ethic of customer service focused on responding to patrons' information needs, a concept called a pull platform is introduced \n      in this book. A library's patrons should \"pull\" services and resources out of a library's collections and services instead of the traditional \n      approach that \"pushes\" resources and services to the patron based on the library's best guesses about the patrons' wants or needs.\n      By taking lessons and examples from successful startups and other lean organizations, this book investigates how applying these \n      principles improves the planning and execution of new library services and resources.\n     </p>\n     <p>\n      Many of these principles focus on library systems \n      and technical services departments but have wider application to the general operation in libraries. The goal of a lean organization is to \n      deliver more services, faster, and with higher quality, to the library's patrons, online visitors, staff, and other librarians.\n     </p>\n    </article>\n  </div>\n </div>\n</div>\n</Layout>)\n\nexport default IntroductionPage\n// Lean library; Memory institutions; Open badges; Pull platform. \n"],"sourceRoot":""}
