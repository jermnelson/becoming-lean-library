	<p><strong>Abstract</strong><br />
    Eric Ries, the originator and founder of the lean startup movement, 
	stresses the importance of what he calls innovation accounting. 
    Innovation accounting is an accounting philosophy originally 
	conceived for use by entrepreneurs in technology startups that diverges 
	from traditional accrual-based accounting used in corporate and 
	nonprofit organizations. While it does not ignore regulatory and 
    administrative requirements provided by traditional accounting systems, 
	innovation accounting encourages the identification and 
    measuring of metrics that provide relevant feedback to the library 
	systems delivering services or resources.
	</p>
	<p>
	The types and methods of gathering statistics from library services and resources is
    reminiscent of ideas and philosophies behind one of the twentieth century's 
    most influential management thinkers and educators, Francis Taylor. Taylor 
	attempted to scientifically optimize the workflows of a 
	typical laborer in a factory. Taylor's ideas have had a large impact on library 
	systems' organization and processes, which, with some 
    modification, can be implemented by a lean library using a variant of innovation 
	accounting that is especially adapted to the needs and 
    circumstances of libraries
