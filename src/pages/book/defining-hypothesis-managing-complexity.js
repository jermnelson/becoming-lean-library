	<p><strong>Abstract</strong><br />
    Managing the increasing complexity of library technology can seem 
	overwhelming to libraries with reduced staffing in technology 
    and operations. Library services platforms, discovery layers, and 
	cloud offerings; mobile operating systems such as Android, iOS, and 
    Windows; and supported tablets and workstations of library patrons 
	and staff are expected services in a library. The lean library approach 
	using the build-measure-learn cycle requires the creation of actionable 
	and specific hypotheses to better measure and respond to the 
    actual requirements of the library's users. This chapter goes through a 
	step-by-step process of creating usable hypotheses in the library's 
    decision making
