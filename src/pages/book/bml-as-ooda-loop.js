	<p><strong>Abstract</strong><br />
    John Boyd, a military theorist and strategic thinker, created a model of 
	how individuals and organizations respond and adapt to changing 
    circumstances in the highly stressful environment of armed conflict.
	</p>
	<p>
    The same analysis and model has been applied to a variety of 
    situations, such as rapid changes of competitors or other external forces, 
	like the introduction of disruptive technology to an established 
    industry. Boyd's model, called the OODA loop, breaks this process into four 
	phases: observation, orientation, decision, and action. 
	</p>
	<p>
	While Boyd's model was initially applied to combat, its structure and lessons 
	help classify the lean startup's build-measure-learn cycle 
    as a specific strategy for moving a library more quickly through its own OODA 
	loop as it responds to changes in its organizational and 
    technological environment.
	</p>
	<p>
	A critical part of the build-measure-learn loop for library services is starting 
	off with a simple tool set and letting tools develop and 
	improve to meet the needs of the library's patrons, librarians, and staff
    </p>
