    <p><strong>Abstract</strong><br />
    This chapter starts with a brief history of libraries, in particular 
            library's technology-focused departments and groups within the library. 
        These organizational units can range from small public libraries where 
            non-information technology staff are responsible for some 
    or all of the library's technology services, to bigger academic 
            libraries with large information technology systems departments that 
    development and deploy large and complex library systems. This chapter 
            also discusses the roles of library systems and technical 
    services systems within the larger library organization and mission. 
            Finally, this chapter examines some general trends in technology 
            and enterprise information management that are affecting and changing 
            library systems today.
