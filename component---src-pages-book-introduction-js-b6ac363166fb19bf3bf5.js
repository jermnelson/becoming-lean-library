Building on a strong ethic of customer service focused on responding to patrons' information needs, a concept called a pull platform is introduced in this book. A library's patrons should \"pull\" services and resources out of a library's collections and services instead of the traditional approach that \"pushes\" resources and services to the patron based on the library's best guesses about the patrons' wants or needs. By taking lessons and examples from successful startups and other lean organizations, this book investigates how applying these principles improves the planning and execution of new library services and resources."),t.a.createElement("p",null,"Many of these principles focus on library systems and technical services departments but have wider application to the general operation in libraries.
